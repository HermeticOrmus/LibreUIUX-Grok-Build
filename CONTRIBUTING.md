## Melt, don't clone

Ports from LibreUIUX-Claude-Code must follow Liquid Gold:

1. Keep model-agnostic design knowledge.
2. Strip Claude-only paths, `model:` pins, Anthropic install residue.
3. Ship as Grok `SKILL.md` / agents under `.grok/` conventions.
4. Teach while helping (Gold Hat).

## Skill format

```
skills/<name>/SKILL.md
```

YAML frontmatter: `name`, `description`. Body: when to use, steps, measurable checks.

## PR bar

- Honest depth: only count what you melt
- No "Grok killer" language
- Link Reality OS in suite footers
